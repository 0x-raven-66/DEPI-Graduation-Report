# README for DEPI Graduation Project Repository

## Virtual Pentesting Lab Project

Welcome to the repository for the **Virtual Pentesting Lab**, a graduation project conducted by the **Yellow Team** as part of the **Department of Electrical, Programming, and Informatics (DEPI)** program. This repository contains all the necessary files, including our **final project report**, and showcases the methodology and results achieved during the project.

---

### üìú **Project Overview**
The project focuses on a comprehensive penetration testing lifecycle targeting a vulnerable FTP server (`vsftpd 2.3.4`) hosted on a **Metasploitable2** virtual machine. The main tasks performed include:
1. **Network Reconnaissance**: Scanning and identifying active hosts and services.
2. **Traffic Analysis**: Investigating network activity using PCAP files.
3. **Exploitation**: Utilizing Metasploit to exploit the vsftpd 2.3.4 vulnerability.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Obtaining root access on the victim machine.

### üìñ **Final Report**
The detailed final report is included in this repository and provides:
- A **step-by-step walkthrough** of the pentesting missions.
- Insights into the scanning and exploitation processes.
- A conclusion summarizing the success of the pentesting lifecycle.

You can access the report in the file [**Final_Project_DEPI(Yellow_Team).pdf**](./Final_Project_DEPI(Yellow_Team).pdf).

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Technologies**

The following tools and resources were essential in the execution of this project:

- **Kali Linux**: For running scans, traffic analysis, and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Wireshark**: For analyzing captured network traffic (PCAP files).
- **Metasploit**: For vulnerability exploitation.
- **Nmap**: For performing comprehensive network reconnaissance and port scanning.
- **GHDB (Google Hacking Database)**: For identifying vulnerabilities and information leakage through advanced search queries.
- **VM Workstation**: Used to set up and manage the virtual machines, including Kali Linux and Metasploitable2, in a controlled environment.
